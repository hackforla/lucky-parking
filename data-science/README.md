Hack for LA analysis of parking citation data

Check out our [data contributor's Wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/lucky-parking/wiki/Data-Team-Contributing-Guide)


#### Running it locally:
It is suggested that you work on a fork of the code. Use the fork button on the repo page to create your own copy.
``` 
# If you're using Windows, install WSL2
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

# Start WSL2 at the command line
bash

# If you're using Mac install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

# If you're using Mac, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install [make for mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)
brew install make

# Update
sudo apt upgrade

# Install Git
sudo apt install git-all

# Git clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/(your Git username here)/lucky-parking.git
cd lucky-parking

# Change branch
git checkout citation-analysis

# Install make and conda
sudo apt install make
cd ..
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Type yes to initialize conda
# Restart shell
exec bash

# If you forgot to initilize conda you might need to add the location of conda to your PATH variable
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-anaconda-path-to-environment-variable/

#If're using WSL2 on Windows you might need to exit and initialize Conda
exit
# Then
bash

# You should now have (base) in front of your prompt

# Remove installer (optional)
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

```
If using VSCode, use Remote-SSH extension as your development environment:

#### Using the Makefile to create data:

```
# Create your conda environment
cd lucky-parking
make create_environment

# Activate the lucky-parking-analysis environment
conda activate lucky-parking-analysis

# Download to data/raw
# Raw data is sampled and saved to data/interim (10% default)
# Sample data is cleaned to data/processed
make data

# To create a smaller or larger sample from full dataset
# Where 0 < frac <= 1 and clean is True/False
# If the sample is cleaned, it ends up in data/processed
# If the sample is not cleaned, it ends up in data/interim
# Example of 20% sampling of dataset and is cleaned
make sample frac=0.2 cleaned=True

# To create serialized data use make serial_data
# Takes newest raw data file in data/interm
# Add geo=true for geojson, geo=false for csv format
# Saves to data/processed
# Example of creation of serialized geojson file
make serial_data geo=true

# Upload serial data to your database
# Make sure that you have the .env file in the root folder
make upload_serial

# Create a local instance of the Lucky Parking PostGIS database using Docker

```
#### To create an AWS EC2 instance to run this repo, follow the steps documented in the references folder: 
[Link to screenshots](references/awsEC2.pdf)

```
# Once you have setup your AWS instance, make sure you run 
chmod 400 your_pem_file.pem

# If you're running Windows
https://gist.github.com/jaskiratr/cfacb332bfdff2f63f535db7efb6df93

# Move your pem file to your .ssh folder
mv your_pem_file.pem ~/.ssh

# Open a terminal and SSH into your instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_pem_file.pem ubuntu@your_aws_host_name_here
```

#### Uploading your changes to your fork
If you haven't already, create a fork of the repo--this is your version of our code from which you will do pull requests from. 
Make sure that you have 2-factor authentication activated. 
Create a personal token by clicking on your avatar the top right corner and then going to -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens and create a new token with the appropriate permissions. Copy this resulting token.
Use the credential store to locally store your password `git config credential.helper cache`
Make changes to your code, add them `git add .`, commit it `git commit -m 'your comment here'`, and push your changes to your fork `git push origin citation-analysis`. 
Enter your username and the token string as your password. Now you can upload changes to your repo using the command line.
